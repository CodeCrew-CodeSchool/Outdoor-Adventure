        <p>"The Uncle Tom's Trail is a short .6 mile trail that descends quickly down 328 stairs to get an amazing view of Lower Yellowstone Falls.  While this trail is short, the 8,000+ elevation makes this trail a challenge as you climb back up all the stairs. This trail is located in the Northern section of Yellowstone National Park within the "Grand Canyon of Yellowstone."  This hike is a must if you visit Yellowstone!" -Youtube video description</p>
