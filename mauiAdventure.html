        <p>"Our trip to Maui this summer was centered around the opportunity to go SCUBA Diving. For my first real open ocean diving experience, it exceeded all of my expectations, and I couldn't have asked for a better dive. We saw countless fish on the reef and many sea turtles. The three dives we went on were at Temple of Doom, Stonewall, and Ulua Beach. We went with the Maui Dive Shop and couldn't recommend their service enough. I'm absolutely hooked on diving now and can't wait for our next trip." -YouTube video description</p>
